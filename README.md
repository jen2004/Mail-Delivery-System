I completed this project during my 5th semester at WGU as a part of the class, Data Structure and Algorithms 2, C950.

The project is a routing and package delivery simulation system designed for a parcel service. I created the application in PyCharm.  It utilizes a hash table to efficiently manage and retrieve package data from CSV files, allowing for fast assignment of packages to trucks based on their unique IDs. The trucks, each with a specific capacity, speed, and mileage, deliver packages in an optimal manner using a nearest neighbor algorithm, prioritizing urgent deliveries. The system tracks the status of packages (At the hub, En route, Delivered) in real time, adjusting package addresses when necessary. Users can query the status of individual packages or all packages assigned to a truck at any given time, providing a clear overview of the delivery process and mileage calculations. The program also allows for easy time-based updates and provides interactive feedback for the user.  The output is displayed to the user in the Run window.

For the complete project requirements, please refer to the “Task Description.pdf” file.  The planning phase of this project is documented in “Task 1.pdf”.  “Task 2.pdf” documents the implementation phase of the project.
